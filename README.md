### **Procedure to Develop an AR-Based E-commerce App Using Android Studio**  

**1. Define Project Requirements**  
   - Decide on the product categories and features for AR visualization (e.g., furniture, apparel).  
   - Define app features such as AR integration, user login, product browsing, and payment gateway.  

---

**2. Set Up Android Studio Environment**  
   - Install the latest version of Android Studio.  
   - Set up a new project with a minimum SDK version compatible with ARCore (Android 7.0 or above).  
   - Configure the project to use Kotlin or Java as the development language.  

---

**3. Integrate ARCore SDK**  
   - Add ARCore dependency in the `build.gradle` file:  
     ```gradle
     implementation 'com.google.ar:core:1.x.x'
     ```  
   - Include ARCore libraries and permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.  
     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
     <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.ar" android:required="true" />
     ```  

---

**4. Set Up 3D Models**  
   - Design or download 3D models of the products in compatible formats like `.glb` or `.gltf`.  
   - Store models locally in the app or host them on a server for dynamic loading.  

---

**5. Implement AR Functionality**  
   - Use `ArFragment` to set up the AR interface.  
   - Enable plane detection for placing 3D objects in real-world environments.  
   - Load and render 3D models using Sceneform:  
     ```kotlin
     val renderableFuture = ModelRenderable.builder()
         .setSource(context, Uri.parse("model.gltf"))
         .build()
         .thenAccept { renderable -> modelRenderable = renderable }
         .exceptionally { throwable -> /* Handle errors */ }
     ```  
   - Allow users to place, rotate, and scale the models.  

---

**6. Add E-commerce Features**  
   - **Product Catalog:** Create a RecyclerView or GridView to display available products.  
   - **Product Details:** Show product descriptions, price, and AR view button.  
   - **Shopping Cart:** Implement functionality to add products to a cart and review selections.  
   - **Payment Gateway:** Integrate payment options using APIs like Razorpay, Stripe, or PayPal.  

---

**7. Backend Integration**  
   - Use Firebase or another backend to manage user accounts, product data, and orders.  
   - Implement APIs for product retrieval, order placement, and payment processing.  

---

**8. Design User Interface**  
   - Create a user-friendly UI using XML for screens like login, product catalog, cart, and checkout.  
   - Use Material Design components for a modern and responsive look.  

---

**9. Test the Application**  
   - Test the AR features on ARCore-compatible devices.  
   - Perform functional testing for browsing, AR placement, cart management, and payments.  
   - Fix any bugs and optimize app performance.  

---

**10. Publish the App**  
   - Generate the APK or App Bundle for your app.  
   - Publish it on the Google Play Store with necessary marketing details like screenshots, descriptions, and keywords.  

---

**Tools and Technologies**  
- **Android Studio** for app development.  
- **ARCore SDK** for AR capabilities.  
- **Firebase** for backend services.  
- **Sceneform** for rendering 3D models.  
- **API Integration** for payment and backend communication.
